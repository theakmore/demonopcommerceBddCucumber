Developed an automation framework to automate https://admin-demo.nopcommerce.com/ website with Behavior Driven Development (BDD) methodology using Cucumber.

## Automated the following features:

    1. Login Feature
    2. Customer Feature
    3. Products Feature
    4. Categories Feature
    5. Manufacturers Feature

## Note:
* Created feature files and corresponding step-definitions.
 * Used Junit and Gherkin launguage and added loggers.
 * Captured the screenshots of failed testcases. 
 * I have also ran this project using maven/cmd and on jenkins.
